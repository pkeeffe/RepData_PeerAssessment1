Initially setup our working directory.

```{r echo=TRUE}
library(dplyr)
setwd("D:/dev/Coursera/assignments/rr_project1/RepData_PeerAssessment1")

```

## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r echo=TRUE}
activity_data = read.csv("data/activity.csv")
steps_per_day <- group_by(activity_data, date)
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r echo=TRUE}
steps_summary <- summarize(steps_per_day, mean_per_day = mean(steps), total_per_day = sum(steps))
print(select(steps_summary,date,total_per_day),n=100)
hist(steps_summary$mean_per_day)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
